Game Development

When I was about 5 ? years old I designed a board game. I don't think it was actually finished to the point of being playable, but the game had various cards and a game board that the players would move across. Naturally the materials were basic, but I understood back then that you had to start somewhere and progress one piece at a time. The same concept holds for making video games: features and mechanics are added one part at a time.

Fruit Wars represents the first several steps to developing more complex and more addicting video games. My approach to game development is also focused on thinking ahead and making the decisions that will make it easiest to add additional features and scaling to the game later. The first big decision I faced was to use crafty.js and build towards tower defense, or use the ember.js library for a turn based strategy game. Both libraries sounded promising from the feedback I'd read online, and I elected for crafty.js because I expected it would be easier to make a fun game in real-time than turn-based. Now that I've had gotten some experience coding in Javascript, the next big question is whether I should proceed via the popular Unity game engine, or keep to pure javascript with node.js. Both routes would facilitate deploying to different platforms and allow for effective scaling for gameplay efficiency. I've seen enough of Unity that I'll try it out but at the same time I am discouraged by the price tag for the premium version (full features cost $75/month).

Most of the features I'll be working on next are simply necessary steps to adding more content and additional features:
<ul><li>Dynamic viewport (game window following character about)</li>
<li>Menus</li>
<li>Responding to mouseclicks</li>
<li>Database integration</li>
<li>Multiplayer?</li></ul>

Once this functionality has been dealt I can really start adding the fun stuff to the game - and by that I mean content. In terms of programming, the fun parts I'm looking forward to tackling down the line include:

<ul><li>AI behavior</li>
<li>Pattern creation in random map generation</li></ul>
