<p>We have survived the first week. The other students seem to accept me as one of their own. Sometimes I even work on coding problems with the others. It is a new environment for everyone, and the tons of work we&#39;re given is sufficient to divert everyone&#39;s attention. Most likely my mustache helps to serve as a distraction - I don&#39;t think anyone suspects my true intention is to devour their souls. Soon it will be inevitable.</p>  
<p>What most impresses me at Launch Academy is the assortment of resources we have access to.  The ratio of instructors to students in phenomenal, we get to use lots of cool tech, and we can choose from a variety of lessons/exercises to reinforce or supplement the core material. It is the perfect environment and will serve nicely as an evil lair where I can work on my mind control device and evoke the agents of the Overlord.</p>
