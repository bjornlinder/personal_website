How I Spend My Saturdays

I've now gotten used to spending my Friday and Saturday nights working on code. Saturday was our second Launch Academy Hackathon, Ship-It-Saturday. My plan had been to add graphics to the Treasure Hunter game I'd made several months. The original game had the same content but was only playable through the command line. Making the game playable through the browser required converting some of it to Javascript so that the browser would remember the player location and which tiles have already been dug. Mission accomplished. 

When the time came to present what we'd been working on in the evening, there was still quite a bit I'd wanted to add to the game and to this website. Naturally I partook in our celebratory keg, but soon thereafter I returned to coding. Why? Primarily because I could make significant improvements in a relatively short period of time. 

Another reason I don't feel the need to go out on the weekends is because I have plenty of fun during the week. Krash and Launch both provide some great speakers Thursday evenings, and there are often other fun activities going on the rest of the week as well: Free conferences Wednesday nights, Krash family dinners Sundays, etc. With all this stuff going on the rest of the week, I am more than happy to spend my Friday and Saturday nights coding.

More fun than going out as well

Game Development

When I was about 5 ? years old I designed a board game. I don't think it was actually finished to the point of being playable, but the game had various cards and a game board that the players would move across. Naturally the materials were basic, but I understood back then that you had to start somewhere and progress one piece at a time. The same concept holds for making video games: features and mechanics are added one part at a time. Fruit Wars represents the first several steps to developing more complex and more addicting video games. My approach to game development is also focused on thinking ahead and making the decisions that will make it easiest to add additional features and scaling to the game later. The first big decision I faced was to use crafty.js and build towards tower defense, or use the ember.js library for a turn based strategy game. Both libraries sounded promising from the feedback I'd read online, and I elected for crafty.js because I expected it would be easier to make a fun game in real-time than turn-based. Now that I've had gotten some experience coding in Javascript, the next big question is whether I should proceed via the popular Unity game engine, or keep to pure javascript with node.js. I've seen enough of Unity to try it out, but at the same time I am discouraged by the price tag for the premium version (full features cost $75/month).
