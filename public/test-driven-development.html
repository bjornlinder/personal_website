<p>Through another week of coding. Doesn't make any difference however, seeing as I'm still at it on the weekend. I've started work on two of my breakable toys - that is, building the foundation for the design. The other projects I've decided to put on the shelf whilst in Launch. Afterall, the two breakable toys I'll be building, I could spend an endless amount of time adding features for either of them. I will also be giving a talk on SEO tomorrow, and should probably spend some more time today preparing for that.

On to the more technical stuff...

<em>Question:
What you struggled with the most when doing TDD. Additionally, what value do you think TDD brings to software development.</em>

Trying out test driven development to write a tax calculator was more difficult than expected. We first though that importing data from a CSV would be the natural place to start, but doing so seemed a more complicated step than we should be doing for the first step. I expect - certainly hope - to have an easier time of it for the next projects.

I feel TDD is certainly useful for designing software, but I don't expect to be using it all the time in the future. As our last speaker Dean told us, TDD is very useful when you have many people contributing to complicated projects. For solo work, I don't think it's strictly necessary. I feel Whether or not to use test driven development depends on the complexity and type of the project in question.
