<h4>Happy Father's Day!</h4>

Healthy enough to cure most common ailments with one serving and composed entirely of ingredients my father is exuberant over, this tomato sauce is for men. In fact, the final taste is so overpowering that anyone else who tries the sauce will undoubtably grimace and immediately reach for the nearest bottle of vodka or Ouzo to chase it with. Ouzo is the recommended drink to accompany your meal; hopefully you will have some on hand. 

You will also find that the directions in this recipe are made for men. The recipe is short, simple, and doesn't waste time dealing with 'ounces', 'tablespoons', or other constructs that serve only to confuse and mislead. Making this tomato sauce will allow you to efficiently prepare an unforgettable culinary experience, helping you return quickly to other manly pursuits like practicing your fire-breathing skills while riding an alligator.

What might you use this tomato sauce for? For starters, don't even think of trying it with pasta. If however you and Fluffy are getting back from a hunting trip with a 300 pound boar and want a marinade to go with those tasty boar chops, then this sauce is for you. If you don't have any fresh boar on hand, the sauce also goes well with stir fry (pictured).

<h5>Directions:</h5>

Mix tomato paste with mustard and olive oil. Make sure you add enough mustard to taste but not so much as to overpower the tomato paste. If you feel the sauce is too thick or pungent for your dish, add water to thin. Add some basil, pepper, and other herbs you picked up in the woods hunting that boar. Mix well and enjoy.
