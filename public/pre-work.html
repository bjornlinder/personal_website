<strong>Life in Boston</strong>
<br><br>
<p>The last several weeks I&#39;ve been in Boston has been a great time. Life has been vastly different for me for many reasons: most notably living in the big city, and living with roommates. Being able to easily get from one part of the city to another is fantastic and something that I appreciate after having spent time in suburbs of Minneapolis. I feel living at Krash (url) is the best living experience I&#39;ve ever had. While the perks are great, in the long run the most important part of living here are the opportunities to make new friends and connections.</p>

<p>The past couple months I&#39;ve had homework to work on through Launch Academy. The homework consisted of numerous ebooks, online tutorials, and exercises, all focused on programming. Despite having finished grad school last spring, I don&#39;t mind having had more homework to go through. The material is all interesting to me and will be essential to pursuing a career in web/software development. Thus I recognize the benefit of covering material prior to the start of the program itself, and the timeline has given me some structure to help motivate me to study.</p>

<strong>Why I Like Programming</strong>
<br><br>
<p>I think what excites me the most about learning programming is the potential to create a wide variety of applications, from an online content management system to computer games to useful software applications. Launch Academy has us work on a &#39;breakable toy&#39; during the program. By the end, everyone should have a unique project to show off. I have several projects in mind for my Breakable Toy and I don&#39;t plan to limit my time to just one of them. I&#39;ve spent some time researching each project and will continue working on them whilst my programming skills improve.</p>

<p>In the midst of the pre-work I made a simple console based game called &#39;Treasure Hunter&#39;. When we learn some rails I intend to upload the game to my site here, but if you want to check it out now (and don&#39;t mind the coding) you are welcome to do so: https://github.com/bjornlinder/fun. I wrote most of the game fairly early on in learning Ruby so the code is rather basic, but the game works and I think it could easily provide 5 minutes of entertainment.</p>

<strong>Pre-Work Status & Most Challenging Topics</strong>
<br><br>
<p>All of the material we&#39;ve been going through is challenging in some respect. Some might be review, but otherwise there&#39;s no significant difference in difficulty from SQL to command line or Ruby. The largest portion of material we have to learn is Ruby, so in that respect learning Ruby is the most challenging of the work we&#39;ve been doing. In particular, there are so many different parts of Ruby programming to learn, and understand how they fit together in best coding practices. Some of the more confusing/elaborate Ruby topics I&#39;ve studied are hashes and the keywords like &#39;self&#39; or &#39;super&#39;. I have a decent understanding of these topics at this point, and will likely just require practice with them to solidify the concepts. At this point I&#39;ve finished most all the required pre-work excepting some Git work, and have gone through several chapters of The Well Grounded Rubyist.
