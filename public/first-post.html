<p>Happy 2014! I am sorry it&#39;s taken so long to share this with you; most of this post was actually written a year ago. Quite a bit has changed since then, though my thoughts on life and keeping a blog have not.</p>  
<p>Why write a blog? I am committing my time to an endeavor which has no direct benefit. I don’t expect to get paid for writing this, nor do I expect a terribly large number of people to see it. However I am a rational person; I wouldn’t engage myself in this if I felt the benefit wasn’t worth the cost (time commitment). I feel I am an economist and statistician at heart; I often like to think of things in terms of economics. If the marginal utility outweighs the marginal cost, the project is a good investment. Naturally there is a great deal of uncertainty in most things we do, but there is nothing inherently wrong with uncertainty. Over the course of our lives, few people are luckier than others. We may think Susan is lucky for winning the lottery, and often that’s the case, but how many lottery tickets did Susan have to buy before winning? We take risks every day – in driving to work, there’s a small but very real chance you’ll end up in a car accident. We don’t normally think of this risk, but safety can be a reason you structure your daily schedule a certain way. We can maximize our chances at succeeding in life through how we live our lives. What’s most important to you in your life? If you’re unemployed and a good job is important to you, you’ll try to maximize your chances of getting a good job by sending out numerous job applications. We each seek to maximize the utility we gain from life by the choices we make each day. There came a point to me in early ‘12 when I concluded I would increase my utility by making a blog; if I could feasibly do so and had the time.</p>
<p>That said, I can see numerous potential benefits from writing publicly. Practicing writing is good for both improving our writing ability and exercising the creative side of our minds. I hope that you as a reader will find the content to be interesting, candid, and worthwhile. Should you do the honor of reading what I post, I would appreciate any feedback/suggestions you might have.</p>
<p>What&#39;s next: February through April I will be in Boston studying programming (Ruby on Rails). I expect I will be able to create some interesting programs on this journey and hopefully get them to the point where I can share them with you. In addition to serious posts like this one, I am also interested in writing music, poetry, short stories, and plays. I won&#39;t be sharing all of my creative endeavors here, but I do hope to share some of them - and hopefully in a variety of genres. </p>
