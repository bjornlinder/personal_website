Adding a database and comments to the blog has proven more difficult than expected. In fact I would say that this project has been the most challenging thing I've done since starting Launch. Most of the struggle was in setting up the remote database and configuring the comments form to connect to it via ActiveRecord. Even made a method to sanitize the data... while it may have been easier to set up the blog in rails, I wanted the flexibility and classiness that comes from a Sinatra app.

We've been learning rails the past couple weeks, and it's been quite a bit of new material. My next big project ('breakable toy') is an ambitious undertaking for the next 3-4 weeks of the program. I'll be using test driven development, JQuery, and if I have time, will allow users to filter results through an engaging user interface. The plan is to launch the application week 9 so that there would be some content on it at the end of the program. I expect the difficult part will be working with JQuery, as I don't have much experience with it yet.

On to the fun stuff: I made a game! It's free, open source, cartoony, and has some annoying sound effects. Supported browsers include Chrome and Firefox. You can play the game at http://fruit-wars.herokuapp.com/ and view the source code at https://github.com/bjornlinder/Fruit-Wars-Game. I am interested in doing some more game development in the future, and making Fruit Wars has been a fun first step. My future plans for the game focus on adding more strategy, eventually making the game play more like a true tower defense game. To do so, I will need to level up my Javascript more first. For the rest of the program however I'll be focusing on my other Breakable Toy.

Fruit Wars:
Destroy the Candy Mountain Apples!

Controls: Recommend using W, A, S, and D to move around (arrow keys work as well but make the browser scroll up and down).
Hire commando frog by pressing T - he costs 95 gold + 5*level and can take more damage as levels progress.
Both your characters and the enemies shoot fireballs automatically when in range.
Levels will present different challenges and you'll need to use Commando Frog wisely. Have fun!
