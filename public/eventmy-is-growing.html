EventMy has moved to the golden land of startups, networking, and tech events… that’s right, Boston. We’ll still be active in Southern Minnesota through <a href='https://twitter.com/mankatohub'>@MankatoHub</a>, and are working on launching new pages focusing on different regions and interests.

This July we started working with students living in Boston. I am very happy to welcome several new interns to the team. Our new team members are helping out with marketing, UI/UX design, social media, and engineering.

<b>Feature Updates:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Track events! Click ‘track’ on the modal popups to save events to your personal calendar. See ‘My Events’ tab to check your tracked events.</li>
  <li>Event scraping is live! Some of the events on our site are now coming from event calendars on the web.</li>
  <li>Calendar interface improved; most recently the single day view wastes less space and displays a short description for events on the page.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes & minor improvements</li>
  <li>We are working on improving our analytics to better understand what types (and locations) of events our users are most interested in.</li>
</ul>

We still have much planned in the way of feature and interface improvements, and going forward we'll be more active in sharing feature updates on social media.
