I've just finished moving my personal website from beckerstoneart.com/bjornlinder to http://bjorn-linder.herokuapp.com. This change is due to the fact that this website, while using the same html and css code, is now dynamically generated content using Ruby on <a href="sinatra.com/intro.html">Sinatra</a>. Adding new blog posts will soon require only saving and uploading text files which are automatically parsed into html. Currently however I still need to create a new hash with data for each blog post (e.g. title, date). In addition to increasing the automation of new blog posts, I will soon be working on adding commenting functionality to the blog. Older posts will not be given this functionality as I feel that would be silly. I feel that adding comments would nice relatively simple practice in database construction, a topic that may be introduced later this week.

I'm also working on adding my Treasure Hunter game to the site. I made the game a couple months ago when I was first learning to code Ruby, so the code is rather ugly. Moving it up to the server will give me more practice integrating ruby with html, css, and Javascript. Finally being able to deploy Ruby applications to the web is pretty sweet. To get the game working properly with Ruby I'll be learning some Ajax, which we won't be getting to in the curriculum until about week 5. Will link to the game here when it's ready!

Another big project I'll be working on will be developing a multiplayer strategy game of some sort - most likely turn-based, but possibly real-time. I'll be writing it in Javascript, most likely using the craft.js library - hence I plan on the game having an isometric game view. The working title is Evolution Wars. Whatever direction the game goes, I expect it to be awesome.

In a few weeks we'll start on Rails. I have a few Ruby on Rails applications I look forward to building, but I will definitely have enough to keep me busy in the meantime.
