Personalized event recommendations is a somewhat general phrase and I’d like to take some time to lift the veil and go into what that means at EventMy. We aim to provide the best event discovery experience possible, and key to that aim is giving users the most relevant results while minimizing the effort expended on their part. Personalized event recommendations are therefore core to our vision for EventMy and something we’ll always be looking to improve. We use a calendar rather than list so users can easily filter events by the date(s) they are most interested in. Similarly, we want to prioritize local results: the closer an event is to a user the better. We also do more advanced event personalization in search results and offering event recommendations to users (e.g. weekly event emails).

First, users can follow other users. At the moment this is straightforward and means we’ll include events created by the user you’re following when we email you with event recommendations. The next step will be for us to also recommend public events that user is tracking. We’ll also want to feature all of these events (when location &amp; date also matches) in the default search results when you visit eventmy.com.

A key component of an events aggregation platform is the event scoring algorithm. The scoring algorithm takes into account factors such as event attendance, price, and some text analysis to rank events according to approximate event quality. This process is inherently very subjective and ideally we’d want to weigh input factors differently according to user preferences, whether derived from data or better yet, explicitly specified by users. Without other user data or search input, event scoring is the primary means to filter which events are returned to new site visitors.

When user interests or keyword input is available, we can filter events using our keyword matching algorithm. In the following section I’ll go into a rather technical overview of how we use the natural language processing capabilities provided by PostgreSQL to match events with keywords.
