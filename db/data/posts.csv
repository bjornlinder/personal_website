pre-work.html,Launch Academy: Reflection on Pre-Work,"Feb 16, 2014",false,,,"Happy 2014! I am sorry it&#39;s taken so long to share this with you; most of this post was actually written a year ago. Quite a bit has changed since then, though my thoughts on life and keeping a blog have not.</p>  
<p>Why write a blog? I am committing my time to an endeavor which has no direct benefit. I don’t expect to get paid for writing this, nor do I expect a terribly large number of people to see it. However I am a rational person; I wouldn’t engage myself in this if I felt the benefit wasn’t worth the cost (time commitment). I feel I am an economist and statistician at heart; I often like to think of things in terms of economics. If the marginal utility outweighs the marginal cost, the project is a good investment."
first-post.html,First Blog Post,"Jan 1, 2014",images/comic.gif,false,,"The last several weeks I&#39;ve been in Boston has been a great time. Life has been vastly different for me for many reasons: most notably living in the big city, and living with roommates. Being able to easily get from one part of the city to another is fantastic and something that I appreciate after having spent time in suburbs of Minneapolis. I feel living at Krash (url) is the best living experience I&#39;ve ever had. While the perks are great, in the long run the most important part of living here are the opportunities to make new friends and connections."
launch-academy-week-1.html,Launch Academy : Week 1,"Feb 22, 2014",images/sudo-sandwich.png,false,,"We have survived the first week. The other students seem to accept me as one of their own. Sometimes I even work on coding problems with the others. It is a new environment for everyone, and the tons of work we&#39;re given is sufficient to divert everyone&#39;s attention. Most likely my mustache helps to serve as a distraction - I don&#39;t think anyone suspects my true intention is to devour their souls. Soon it will be inevitable."
project-updates.html,Programming Updates - Sinatra & Other Projects,"Mar 3, 2014",false,,,"I've just finished moving my personal website from beckerstoneart.com/bjornlinder to http://bjorn-linder.herokuapp.com. This change is due to the fact that this website, while using the same html and css code, is now dynamically generated content using Ruby on Sinatra. Adding new blog posts will soon require only saving and uploading text files which are automatically parsed into html."
test-driven-development.html,Test Driven Development,"Mar 9, 2014",false,,"Through another week of coding. Doesn't make any difference however, seeing as I'm still at it on the weekend. I've started work on two of my breakable toys - that is, building the foundation for the design. The other projects I've decided to put on the shelf whilst in Launch. Afterall, the two breakable toys I'll be building, I could spend an endless amount of time adding features for either of them. I will also be giving a talk on SEO tomorrow, and should probably spend some more time today preparing for that.

On to the more technical stuff..."
