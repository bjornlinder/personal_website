		<p>I grew up in Mankato and graduated from West High School in 2006. Growing up I enjoyed skiing, playing tennis, and visiting Germany every summer. One of my most memorable moments was finding a Triceratops nose horn on a fossil dig in Montana. </p>
    <p>I studied at Carleton College and graduated with a degree in Economics. While in college I was active in many clubs and activities ranging from chess to folk singing to table tennis. Academically I focused on math and statistics as well as economics, and spent a semester abroad in Sweden.</p>
    <p>After graduating college I spent some time working in a distribution business in Germany  selling equestrian supplies. I returned to Mankato for graduate school and received my MBA from MNSU in May 2013. I spent the next several months working independently in web design and consulting, then moved to Boston in February 2014 to study coding at Launch Academy.</p>
