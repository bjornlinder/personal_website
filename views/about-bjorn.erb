		  <h4>Hello there! Welcome to my 'about' page!</h4>
        </div>
		<p>I  grew up in Mankato and graduated from West High    School in 2006. Growing up I enjoyed skiing,  playing tennis, and visiting Germany  every summer. One of my most memorable moments was finding a Triceratops nose  horn on a fossil dig in Montana. </p>
        <p>I  studied at Carleton College and graduated with a degree  in Economics. While in college I was active in many clubs and activities  ranging from chess to folk singing to table tennis. Academically I focused on  math and statistics as well as economics, and spent a semester abroad in Sweden.</p>
        <p>After  graduating college I spent some time working in a distribution business in Germany  selling equestrian supplies. I decided to return to Mankato for graduate  school and received my MBA from MNSU in May. Professionally, I am interested  in learning programming so I can better help companies expand online, and  launch some businesses of my own. Current projects of mine include this site,  beckerstoneart.com, culbacproducts.com, mankatomosaic.com, writing a business plan for a landscaping company. I have more projects in mind for the future once I've learned more back-end web development.</p>
        <p>I've been actively engaged with the community since returning to Mankato. I act with  Mankato Mosaic Theatre Company and am involved in social media projects dealing  with local events. I love to stay active and spend time with friends.  I regularly takes time to play poker, dance, and go rock climbing. </p>
